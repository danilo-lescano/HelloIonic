All poisons or diseases active within her 30-foot aura have an onset of 1 round and a frequency of 1/minute. Impregnated creatures within her aura gestate in 2d4 rounds. Any creature born within her aura gains a mutation as if it were the drakainia&#8217;s spawn, though if the creature&#8217;s parent was not impregnated by the drakainia, the creature born is an infant of the kind its biological parents would produce, and doesn&#8217;t count toward the CR limit the drakainia can spawn per day.</p> \n <h4><a name=\"TOC-Impregnate-Surrogate-Su-\"></a>Impregnate Surrogate (Su)</h4> \n <p>A drakainia can disgorge a monstrous embryo into the mouth of a living, corporeal creature that is <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned\">pinned</a> or <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>.

An impregnated creature&#8217;s pregnancy lasts for 2d4 rounds. During this pregnancy, the victim is <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated\">nauseated</a> until the monster bursts forth from the victim&#8217;s abdomen, which deals 10d6 points of damage to the pregnant creature and applies the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken\">broken</a> condition to any armor it is wearing. <a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-disease\" style=\"font-style:italic\">Remove disease</a> (DC 28) eliminates the unnatural embryo.

The creature spawned by means of this impregnation is any creature of the drakainia&#8217;s choice that is at least one size category smaller than the creature she impregnated.

While the truth of their origins has been long forgotten, most sages subscribe to one of two theories. The first states the creatures are the failed results of horrific experiments performed by the dark and nameless sorcerers of an ancient snake cult in their attempts to ensorcel their followers. The second theory contends the inphidians were once a cult of snake worshipers cursed by an ancient snake-god for some transgression against the ethos. Whatever the truth, it appears as of late that the inphidians have evolved into true race, beyond the machinations of arcane experiments or curses. While there exist several known species, recent reports describe encounters with yet unidentified inphidians and others are sure to surface as encounters with the race grow more frequent.</p>"},{"name":"Manimal Triceratops","link":"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/manimal-triceratops/","description":"","statblock":" \n <p class=\"title\">Manimal Triceratops <span style=\"float: right\">CR 10</span></p> \n <p><b>XP 9,600</b> <br> CN Huge monstrous humanoid (augmented animal) <br> <b>Init</b> -1; <b><span>Senses</span></b> <span> low-light vision, </span> <span><span style=\"font-size:13px\"><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span>scent</span></a><span>; </span><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span>Perception</span></a></span> +24 </span> </p>\n <p class=\"divider\">DEFENSE</p> \n <p><b><span>AC</span></b><span> 21, touch 7, flat-footed 21 (–1 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dex</a>, +14 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Bonus-Natural-Armor-\">natural</a>, –2 size)</span><br> <b><span>hp</span></b><span> 133 (14d10+56)</span><br> <b><span>Fort</span></b><span> +10, </span><b><span>Ref</span></b><span> +8, </span><b><span>Will</span></b><span> +10</span></p> \n <p class=\"divider\">OFFENSE</p> \n <p><b><span>Speed</span></b><span> 30 ft.</span><br> <b><span>Melee</span></b><span> greatclub +20/+15/+10 (3d8+8), gore +17 (2d10+12/19-20)</span><br> <b><span>Space</span></b><span> 15 ft.; </span><b><span>Reach</span></b><span> 15 ft.</span><br> <b><span>Special Attacks</span></b><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Powerful-Charge-Ex-\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span>powerful charge</span></a><span> (gore, 4d10+16), </span><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Trample-Ex-\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span>trample</span></a><span> (1d8+12, DC 25)</span></p> \n <p><span><b>Tactics</b> A manimal triceratops usually tramples smaller opponents on its way to charge more worthy foes.
